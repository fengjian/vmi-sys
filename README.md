# vmi-sys

Introducing the latest Rust bindings for libvmi, designed primarily for KVMi integration. This project aims to provide a robust and efficient interface for leveraging the capabilities of libvmi within Rust-based applications. With these bindings, developers can seamlessly integrate KVMi functionality into their Rust projects, enabling powerful virtual machine introspection capabilities for security and monitoring purposes. Join us in exploring the cutting-edge possibilities of Rust and libvmi for advanced virtualization-based security solutions.

### Requirements

- Bindgen requires `libclang`: `apt-get install llvm-3.9-dev libclang-3.9-dev clang-3.9`

- LibVMI can be installed via [these instructions](http://libvmi.com/docs/gcode-install.html).
